# Security Considerations

Important security considerations and best practices for the EtherSafe inheritance system.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Trustless Operation
- **No centralized dependencies**: The system operates entirely on-chain without relying on external oracles or centralized services
- **Cryptographic verification**: All state changes are verified using cryptographic proofs
- **Immutable contracts**: Core logic cannot be changed after deployment

### 2. Access Control
- **Owner-only configuration**: Only EOA owners can configure inheritance
- **Inheritor-only claims**: Only designated inheritors can claim inheritance
- **Strict delegation control**: Only verified inheritors can control inherited EOAs

### 3. State Integrity
- **On-chain verification**: Account activity is verified using nonce changes only
- **Merkle proof validation**: Uses cryptographic proofs for state verification
- **Block hash verification**: Prevents manipulation of historical state

## Potential Attack Vectors

### 1. Premature Inheritance Claims

**Risk**: Inheritor attempts to claim inheritance while account is still active.

**Mitigation**:
```solidity
// System verifies account remained inactive throughout the period
function claimInheritance(address account, ...) external {
    InactivityRecord memory record = inactivityRecords[account];

    // Verify account nonce hasn't changed since inactivity was marked
    // Note: Only nonce is checked, not balance, because balance can change
    // without account owner activity (receiving transfers, rewards, etc.)
    require(
        currentAccountStateProof.nonce == record.startNonce,
        "Account still active"
    );
}
```

### 2. Balance-Based Attack Prevention

**Risk**: Attacker sends ETH to inactive accounts to prevent inheritance.

**Mitigation**: The system **only** checks nonce changes, not balance changes:
- Balance can increase without account owner activity (transfers, rewards, airdrops)
- Only nonce changes indicate the account owner sent a transaction
- Prevents attackers from blocking inheritance by sending funds to inactive accounts

**Security Benefit**: This design makes the inheritance system resistant to griefing attacks where malicious actors try to prevent legitimate inheritance by sending small amounts of ETH to inactive accounts.

### 3. False Inactivity Marking

**Risk**: Malicious actor marks an active account as inactive.

**Mitigation**:
- Anyone can mark inactivity, but the system verifies actual account state
- Account owners can continue normal operations to prevent inheritance
- Multiple verification layers ensure accuracy

### 3. EIP-7702 Delegation Attacks

**Risk**: Unauthorized delegation or delegation to malicious contracts.

**Mitigation**:
```solidity
// Controller verifies inheritance before allowing execution
function execute(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external {
    require(inheritanceManager.isInheritanceClaimed(address(this)), "Not claimed");
    
    (address inheritor,,) = inheritanceManager.getInheritanceConfig(address(this));
    require(msg.sender == inheritor, "Not inheritor");
}
```

### 4. State Proof Manipulation

**Risk**: Malicious state proofs to fake account activity or inactivity.

**Current Status**: State proofs are not yet implemented (marked as unused parameters).

**Future Mitigation**:
```solidity
function verifyAccountState(
    address account,
    bytes32 stateRoot,
    bytes calldata stateProof
) internal pure returns (bool) {
    // Verify Merkle proof against state root
    // Ensure account state is accurately represented
    return MerkleProof.verify(stateProof, stateRoot, keccak256(abi.encode(account)));
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Inheritance Configuration

```solidity
// Use reasonable inactivity periods (minimum 30 days)
function configureInheritance(address inheritor, uint256 period) external {
    require(period >= 30 days, "Period too short");
    require(inheritor != address(0), "Invalid inheritor");
    require(inheritor != msg.sender, "Cannot inherit to self");
    
    inheritanceManager.configureInheritance(msg.sender, inheritor, period);
}
```

### 2. Secure Delegation Setup

```solidity
// Only set up delegation after inheritance is properly claimed
function setupDelegation(address eoaAccount, address controller) external {
    require(
        inheritanceManager.isInheritanceClaimed(eoaAccount),
        "Inheritance not claimed"
    );
    
    (address inheritor,,) = inheritanceManager.getInheritanceConfig(eoaAccount);
    require(msg.sender == inheritor, "Not inheritor");
    
    // Set up EIP-7702 delegation
    setEIP7702Delegation(eoaAccount, controller);
}
```

### 3. Transaction Verification

```solidity
// Always verify transaction parameters before execution
function secureExecute(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external {
    // Verify inheritance and access control
    require(inheritanceManager.isInheritanceClaimed(address(this)), "Not claimed");
    
    (address inheritor,,) = inheritanceManager.getInheritanceConfig(address(this));
    require(msg.sender == inheritor, "Not inheritor");
    
    // Additional safety checks
    require(to != address(0), "Invalid target");
    require(value <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance");
    
    (bool success, bytes memory result) = to.call{value: value}(data);
    require(success, "Execution failed");
}
```

## Operational Security

### 1. Key Management

**EOA Owner Keys**:
- Store securely with proper backup procedures
- Consider multi-signature setups for high-value accounts
- Plan for secure key transition to inheritors

**Inheritor Keys**:
- Inheritors should have secure key management practices
- Consider using hardware wallets for inheritance control
- Plan for emergency access procedures

### 2. Monitoring

**Account Activity**:
```solidity
// Monitor for unexpected activity during inactivity periods
function monitorAccountActivity(address account) external view returns (bool) {
    if (!activityRecords[account].inactivityStart > 0) return false;
    
    ActivityRecord memory record = activityRecords[account];
    return (
        account.nonce != record.startNonce || 
        account.balance != record.startBalance
    );
}
```

**Inheritance Status**:
```solidity
// Regular checks on inheritance configurations
function checkInheritanceStatus(address account) external view returns (
    bool configured,
    bool claimed,
    uint256 timeRemaining
) {
    configured = inheritanceManager.isInheritanceConfigured(account);
    claimed = inheritanceManager.isInheritanceClaimed(account);
    
    if (configured && !claimed) {
        ActivityRecord memory record = activityRecords[account];
        if (record.inactivityStart > 0) {
            InheritanceConfig memory config = inheritanceConfigs[account];
            uint256 claimTime = record.inactivityStart + config.inactivityPeriod;
            timeRemaining = claimTime > block.timestamp ? claimTime - block.timestamp : 0;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Emergency Procedures

**Account Recovery**:
- EOA owners should maintain emergency access to revoke inheritance
- Consider social recovery mechanisms for critical accounts
- Plan for inheritance disputes and resolution procedures

**System Upgrades**:
- Contracts are immutable for security, but new versions can be deployed
- Migration procedures should be well-documented
- Backward compatibility should be maintained

## Audit Considerations

### 1. Code Review Focus Areas

- Access control mechanisms
- State transition logic
- EIP-7702 integration security
- Integer overflow/underflow protection
- Reentrancy protection

### 2. Testing Requirements

- Comprehensive unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests with EIP-7702 delegation
- Edge case testing (timing attacks, state manipulation)
- Gas optimization analysis
- Formal verification of critical functions

### 3. External Dependencies

- OpenZeppelin contracts for standard implementations
- EIP-7702 specification compliance
- Ethereum state root and block hash reliability

## Deployment Security

### 1. Contract Verification

```solidity
// Verify contract addresses and configurations
function verifyDeployment() external view returns (bool) {
    // Check inheritance manager is properly configured
    require(address(inheritanceManager) != address(0), "Invalid manager");
    
    // Verify controller points to correct manager
    require(
        controller.inheritanceManager() == inheritanceManager,
        "Manager mismatch"
    );
    
    return true;
}
```

### 2. Initial Configuration

- Deploy contracts with proper constructor parameters
- Verify contract addresses before configuration
- Test with small amounts before full deployment

### 3. Network Considerations
